# SOAR Home Lab (Wazuh + Shuffle + TheHive + Cortex)

This project showcases a basic Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) setup using open-source tools: Wazuh (SIEM), Shuffle (Automation), TheHive (Ticketing), and Cortex (Threat Intel Enrichment). The lab simulates real-world alerting, ticket creation, and automated enrichment workflows.

## 🧰 Stack

- Wazuh (SIEM + Agent)
- Shuffle (SOAR)
- TheHive (Alert Management)
- Cortex (Threat Intelligence Enrichment)

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- Ubuntu/Debian-based VMs
- Docker Engine installed on your WSL or Linux host
- Basic networking setup (e.g., `/etc/hosts` configuration)
- Admin access to modify service files (Wazuh `ossec.conf`)
- Internet access for enrichment API lookups

## 🚀 What This Lab Does

- Wazuh detects suspicious activity (scheduled task creation)
- Alert sent to Shuffle via webhook
- Shuffle automates:
  - Alert creation in TheHive
  - Enriches with observables (e.g., IP, file hashes via Wazuh logs)
- Cortex enriches observables (future step or optional)
