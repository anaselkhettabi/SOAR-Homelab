# SOAR Home Lab

A simple home lab for learning Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) using open-source tools.

## What is This Lab? 🛡️

This project helps you explore how security teams detect, investigate, and respond to threats using:

- **Wazuh** for threat detection (SIEM)
- **Shuffle** for automating security workflows (SOAR)
- **TheHive** for case management
- **Cortex** for threat intelligence enrichment

All components run in Docker containers for easy setup.

## How Does It Work? 🔗

1. **Wazuh** detects suspicious activity on endpoints.
2. **Shuffle** receives alerts and automates responses:
    - Creates cases in **TheHive**
    - Enriches data with **Cortex** (optional)
3. You can follow the flow from detection to investigation and response.

## Quick Start 🚀

- **Requirements:** Docker, Linux, admin access, internet connection.
- **Setup:** See [`setup/`](setup/) for installation and connection steps.
